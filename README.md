## Overview

This is a solution to the [Equalizer landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/equalizer-landing-page-7VJ4gp3DE).

### The challenge

The challenge was to build a responsive page from a figma design (https://www.figma.com/file/HB7XoWK6Ufc0Fy2TYawY2i/equalizer-landing-page?node-id=0%3A63&t=27GsXuWBErHidiZB-0) with different hover states for interactive elements.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I practised building responsive web pages while working through this project. I tried to use percentages rather than fixed length units. Also I looked deeper into background image properties in CSS.

### Continued development

I would like to focus more on positioning objects in future projects, and practise using different types of length units to get the best outcome in terms of responsive design.
